###monitor nodes and repeat once this node is complete


#########adding a new node

update your elasticsearch.yml in these section.

– Change Cluster Name

# Must be existing cluster name
cluster.name: techieroop
– Configure node name and type of the node

node.name: newnode
# If add node only as a data node. If you want to add node as master then keep this value "true"
node.master: false
node.data: true
– Configure number of shard and replicas

# Shard and replica value should be same as existing node configuration.
index.number_of_shards: 5
index.number_of_replicas: 1
– Discovery settings

This is the most important configuration. Write your master node ip or host name(in my example it is 127.0.0.2) . So that your new node can join to your master node.

# 2. Configure an initial list of master nodes in the cluster
# to perform discovery when new nodes (master or data) are started:
#
#discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["host1", "host2:port"]
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ['127.0.0.2']
3) Restart the Elasticsearch node.

These are the important config changes we should do while installation Elasticsearch. After the successfully installation you can check new node through Cluster API.

curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_nodes'
